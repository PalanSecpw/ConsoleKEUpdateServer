# ConsoleKEUpdateServer

WARNING! This repo is not the repo of ConsoleKE! It is the repository that hosts the game updates. The files are in the "update" branch.

## Why?

The change was made as Kade Engine servers report the PC version, not the console version. The file known as Version.DownloadMe is read by FNF to determine if the game is obsolete. For example, if on the Kade Engine Server the latest version is 1.9.0 but the consoleke team does not 'brought to consoles, the latest version of Kade Engine for console is marked on this server, not the latest version for PC .

## This is not a server!

The eyes are made to look at the nature, objects and enviroments active on Github, no?
